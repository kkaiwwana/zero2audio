### ðŸ§© Project Overview
Zero2Audio is an educational repository that implements a range of classic and interesting models and algorithms in audio and music processing, using the simplest possible approach.

In this repo, youâ€™ll find:

-  Executable and interactive Jupyter notebooks

-  Modular implementations of core components from key models

-  Supplementary examples or visualizations when necessary

-  Each notebook is self-contained and functionally complete


### ðŸ§  What You Shouldn't Expect
This project does not aim to provide:

 - **Extensive theoretical discussions, motivations, or proofs**

   - It intentionally omits most in-depth textual explanations, as it focuses on well-established models and algorithms, and they are already widely available online. This repo is designed more as a practical complement to those readings.

 - **Full training pipelines or large-scale experiments**

   - Most models in this field require significant data and compute resources. To keep things lightweight and accessible, all notebooks use virtual or synthetic data, and no training is included.

 - **Complete engineering-level implementations**

   - It strips away auxiliary or production-related details to focus purely on the core logic. The implementations aim to be efficient and clear, though they may not always be optimal.
